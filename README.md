## Usage

This is a 2 player memorygame where you need to find more pairs than your oppenent in the least possible moves.

- You type in the names of the players.
- Each player has a total of 60 seconds and if they don't choose in 5 seconds, then they will lose their turn.
- Each miss costs a life. If a player runs out of lives than it' game over.
- If a player can succesfully get 3 pairs in a row than the remaining cards get shuffled.

- Note: I've had a slight problem with the css not loading so I've fixed it I hope it's ok.
